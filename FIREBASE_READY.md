## Files Modified

- ✅ `.env.local` - Added your Firebase credentials
- ✅ `src/lib/firebase.ts` - Updated initialization with better error handling
- ✅ `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Already configured for Firebase (no changes needed)

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Application (Do This Now!)
- Try signing up with an email
- Try logging in with that email
- Try Google sign-in
- Refresh and verify you stay logged in

### 2. Set Up Additional Features (Optional)
- Email verification (Firebase Console → Authentication → Email Action Settings)
- Password reset functionality
- Custom user claims for roles
- User profile data in Firestore

### 3. Enable Required Auth Methods in Firebase Console
Make sure these are enabled in your Firebase Console:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select expensetracker67 project
3. Go to Authentication → Sign-in method
4. Enable:
   - ✅ Email/Password
   - ✅ Google (should be pre-enabled)
   - Optionally: Apple, Facebook, etc.

### 4. Production Deployment
When ready to deploy:
- Use environment variables for Firebase config
- Set up Firebase Hosting or deploy to your server
- Enable CORS properly
- Set up backup strategies

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important:** Your .env.local file is:
- ✅ Git-ignored (won't be committed)
- ✅ Only used in local development
- ✅ Safe to share Firebase API keys (they're public by design)

For production deployment:
- Use environment variables from your hosting platform
- Same values can be used (Firebase secures data with Security Rules)
- Set up Firestore Security Rules to protect user data

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase is not initialized"
**Solution:** 
- Check dev console for error message
- Verify .env.local has all values
- Restart dev server (npm run dev)

### Issue: Sign-up/Login fails
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for error details
- Ensure Email/Password is enabled in Firebase Console
- Try test@example.com format

### Issue: Google Sign-In not working
**Solution:**
- Verify Google OAuth is enabled in Firebase
- Check that your domain is whitelisted (should be auto)
- Try in Incognito window to clear cookies

### Issue: Session not persisting
**Solution:**
- Firebase handles this automatically
- Check if third-party cookies are blocked
- Try different browser or Incognito mode

## Console Output to Expect

When the app loads with Firebase configured, you should see in DevTools Console:
```
✅ Firebase initialized successfully
```

If you see:
```
⚠️ Firebase environment variables are missing
```

Then check your .env.local file again.
